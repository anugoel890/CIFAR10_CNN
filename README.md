# Image Classification: Convolutional Neural Network on CIFAR10 dataset using Pytorch 


In this tutorial, we explain a simple real world example of Convolutional Neural Network - image classification using Pytorch. CNN is a deep learning algorithm mainly used for image analyzing.

For this we use CIFAR10 Image Database for training, validating and testing our model. CIFAR10 dataset consists of images that represent the 10 label classes - airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck. It also contains the output labels represented by these images. These images are of size 3 X 32 X 32 which means these are 3-channel colored images of 32 X 32 pixels. 

Here, we use Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) for minimizing the cross entropy loss function.
